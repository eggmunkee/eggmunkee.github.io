      <p>
        We are a group of Americans who are tired of the unconstitutional, tyrannical direction our
        country is headed. We are taking grassroots action to pressure elected leaders and elect
        future candidates to address these issues and restore the Republic, as well as exposing
        repeat propaganda media offenders and distributing journalism outside of controlled channels
        to the people.

      <p>
        We are working to get involved in local politics and to make a difference in the party
        direction by becoming a Precinct Committeeman or Chair where you live. It's the best option
        if a seat is available. We also need Precinct Captains and Block Captains to assist your
        neighborhood with the best candidate information and assisting voters on election day with
        reminders and help to the polls.
