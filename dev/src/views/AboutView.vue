      <strong class="blue">Precinct Strategy</strong> is the key strategy to step into the roughly
      50% vacant Precinct Chair seats in the Republican Party. Becoming a voting member of the party
      allows America First to take over the party from the bottom up, where the selection of state
      and national delegates is decided. <strong class="blue">National delegates</strong> elect the
      RNC leaders and
      <strong class="blue">have the final say on the Presidential nomination</strong>.
